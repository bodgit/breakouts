This is a breakout board for the ubiquitous and idiosyncratic SCART connector
which is popular on A/V equipment throughout Europe.

I was prototyping a cicuit on a breadboard and wanted to use such a connector
yet the pin spacing on the connector just isn't suitable for breadboard.

Despite finding breakout boards for VGA/HDMI/S-Video connectors, etc. I
couldn't find anyone with a SCART breakout so here one is. Literally a single
SCART female connector with each pin exposed on a row of 21 0.1" spaced pins
suitable for breadboard. The latest version of the board now has the pinouts
as documented at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCART) printed on
the top layer so you don't have to remember what all 21 pins do.

Here's the first version of the board as a bare PCB as fabricated by
[OSH Park](https://oshpark.com) and a populated board with a SCART connector
purchased from [RS](http://rswww.com) or [eBay](http://www.ebay.co.uk):
