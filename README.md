# SCART breakout board

This is a breakout board for the ubiquitous and idiosyncratic SCART connector
which is popular on A/V equipment throughout Europe.

I was prototyping a cicuit on a breadboard and wanted to use such a connector
yet the pin spacing on the connector just isn't suitable for breadboard.

Despite finding breakout boards for VGA/HDMI/S-Video connectors, etc. I
couldn't find anyone with a SCART breakout so here one is. Literally a single
SCART female connector with each pin exposed on a row of 21 (ok, 12+9, blame
Eagle CAD!) 0.1" spaced pins suitable for breadboard.

Here's a bare PCB as fabricated by [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com) and a
populated board with a SCART connector purchased from [RS](http://rswww.com)
or [eBay](http://www.ebay.co.uk):

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCART for the pinouts.
